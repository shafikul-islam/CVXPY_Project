# CVXPY_Project
The project employs the CVXPY library in Python to tackle two distinct optimization challenges. First, it addresses the Cheapest Network Flow Problem, aiming to optimize supply distribution across a network while minimizing costs and respecting capacity constraints. Second, it highlights an attempt to solve an optimization problem using CVXPY. This project underscores CVXPY's utility in formulating and solving complex optimization tasks, offering insights into both successful implementations in convex optimization.
